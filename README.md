## Description
The script `quadratic_equation.py` contains a function *get_roots(a, b, c)* that solves a quadratic equation `ax^2+bx+c = 0` in real numbers.
Include unittest `tests.py` for testing purposes and can be run as:
`$ python tests.py`


# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)

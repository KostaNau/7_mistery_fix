# Quadratic Equations Solver

## Description
The script `quadratic_equation.py` contains a function *get_roots(a, b, c)* that solves a quadratic equation `ax^2+bx+c = 0` in real numbers.

Including unittest `tests.py` for testing purposes and `pre-commit` hook for running unittest before any commit. The `pre-commit` hook is run fist before you even type in a commit message. Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit.

For more information see [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)g

## Usage

Copy `pre-commit` file in `.git/hooks`. 


# Project Goals
